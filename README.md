# dcind (Docker-Compose-in-Docker) For Concourse

![build status](https://ci.concourse-ci.org/api/v1/teams/tay/pipelines/dcind/jobs/build-and-publish/badge)

Alpine based image that lets you run Docker inside a Concourse task. Task must have `privileged: true` for Docker to start.

## Usage

Use it in a task config:
```yaml
image_resource:
  type: registry-image
  source:
    repository: taylorsilva/dcind
```

Pull it in as a resource to use as a task image:
```yaml
resoures:
- name: dcind
  icon: docker
  type: registry-image
  source:
    repository: taylorsilva/dcind
    tag: latest

jobs:
...
  - get: dcind
  - task: doing-things
    image: dcind
    privileged: true
```

## Tags
The Docker version is used to tag releases of the image. A new image is
published everyday to ensure OS packages to up to date.

There are three kinds of tags being published, two rolling and one static.

Rolling Tags:
- `latest`: points to the latest image pushed which contains the latest versions of Docker and Docker-Compose
- `DOCKER_VERSION`: This tag is the docker version (e.g. `20.10.6`) and is republished daily. Only the latest version of docker is republished. Older versions will become stale.

Static Tag:
- `DOCKER_VERSION-YYYYmmdd`: This tag is the docker version and is republished daily. Only the latest version of docker is republished.

## Example

Here is an example of a Concourse [job](https://concourse-ci.org/jobs.html)
that uses `taylorsilva/dcind` image to run a bunch of containers in a task, and
then runs the integration test suite. You can find a full version of this
example in the [`example`](example) directory.

Note that `docker-lib.sh` has bash dependencies, so it is important to use `bash` in your task.

```yaml
  - name: integration
    plan:
      - aggregate:
        - get: code
          params: {depth: 1}
          passed: [unit-tests]
          trigger: true
        - get: redis
          params: {save: true}
        - get: busybox
          params: {save: true}
      - task: Run integration tests
        privileged: true
        config:
          platform: linux
          image_resource:
            type: docker-image
            source:
              repository: amidos/dcind
          inputs:
            - name: code
            - name: redis
            - name: busybox
          run:
            path: bash
            args:
              - -cex
              - |
                source /docker-lib.sh
                start_docker

                # Strictly speaking, preloading of Docker images is not required.
                # However, you might want to do this for a couple of reasons:
                # - If the image comes from a private repository, it is much easier to let Concourse pull it,
                #   and then pass it through to the task.
                # - When the image is passed to the task, Concourse can often get the image from its cache.
                docker load -i redis/image
                docker tag "$(cat redis/image-id)" "$(cat redis/repository):$(cat redis/tag)"

                docker load -i busybox/image
                docker tag "$(cat busybox/image-id)" "$(cat busybox/repository):$(cat busybox/tag)"

                # This is just to visually check in the log that images have been loaded successfully
                docker images

                # Run the container with tests and its dependencies.
                docker-compose -f code/example/integration.yml run tests

                # Cleanup.
                # Not sure if this is required.
                # It's quite possible that Concourse is smart enough to clean up the Docker mess itself.
                docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)

```
